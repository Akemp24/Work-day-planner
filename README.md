# Work-Day-Planner

## Description

This work day planner was made to help stay organized throughout a busy day by being able to note what all you have to do for the day. This will make it easer to plan activities for the day while hopefully staying on schedule. This helped me learn more about JavaScript/Jquery. It has helped me understand DOM manipulation as well as being able to effectively use and understand the documentation for DayJS. 

## Usage

To use this web application simply type in the task you have for the timeblock it is schedule. Click on the save button to the right and your task will be saved. Also to note, the color gray means that the time is in the past, the color red means it is that current hour, and the color green means that that time has not yet came (so future).
